<p> New York City’s newest job posting for a director of rodent mitigation, dubbed the “Rat Czar,” has people laughing, but the reason behind it doesn’t: to curb the rats. </p>

<p> Mayor Eric Adams announced his “Rat Action Plan” in November which would expand the city’s already existing efforts to get rid of the rats. </p>

<p> "There's nothing I hate more than rats," Mayor Adams said in a statement. "Getting our city clean and ridding our streets of these filthy creatures are key to our recovery." </p>

<p> Between 2019 and 2021, there were 73,752 complaints lodged with 311 for mouse and rat sightings. Experts estimate there are 2 billion rats in New York City, this means there’s approximately one rat for every four New Yorkers.  </p>

<p>   “Rats will hate this,” the job listing states. “But 8.8 million New Yorkers and your city government stand ready to work with you to reduce the rat population, increase cleanliness, and prevent pestilence."
</p>

<p> This means the job of the future Rat Czar is a tough one. While 311 data is an easy way to get a snapshot of what’s happening in the city, it isn’t perfect. Some zip codes appeared to have a "low" or did not have any formal complaints, this does not mean there were not any rodents spotted during this time.
 </p>

 <p> Sanitation Commissioner Jessica Tisch said, “The rats don’t run this city… we do.” </p>

 <p> Data for 2022 shows otherwise. As of Dec. 18, there have already been <b> 40,229 rodent-related complaints </b> lodged to 311.  </p>

 <p> But why is this? Several reasons, according to rat experts:  </p>

<p> <b> Rodents are scavengers" </b> In 2020, rat and mouse sightings appear to go down but this could be because people were spending more time indoors due to the COVID-19 lockdowns. In addition to this, rodents live underground and are willing to go deep.  These furry vermin aren’t adverse to seeking out food in obscure places such as gutters, drains, or their own homemade rat tunnels in industrial areas.  </p>

<p> <b> Rodents are smart: </b> Do you remember the several times a photo of a #PizzaRat went viral? Rodents are quick to learn where humans dispose of their food and are waiting for the right moment to snag their next meal.  </p>

<p> <b> Rodents have adapted to city live: </b> Their teeth are constantly growing and the only thing they can’t chew through is steel. Rodents’ super strong teeth allow them to burrow their way through almost anything and is sometimes how they end up living in your stove.  In addition to this, their bodies are able to squeeze through tiny spaces; they only need a hole the size of their skull. </p>


<p> The best way to avoid rats in your home is to seal all holes and cracks. The city recommends using the 311 app or hotline to report sightings of rodents. </p>
